# HealthMyMenu

HealthMyMenu is an application that combines fitness information with a food recommendation system based on restaurant menus.

So, basically you can 

- insert your macros and your preference for us to calculate your daily macro goals.
- pick a restaurant and be like "I wanna have something light today, what do I got at this place?"
- our app then tailors your macro goals to recommendations it makes for you.
